# agile-final-project
This repository contains the final project for Agile methodology training. It demonstrates the process of creating and managing a product backlog, refining stories, planning and executing a sprint, and simulating a real-world Agile sprint workflow.

The project involves building the back-end product catalog for an e-commerce website with functionalities like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products, as well as features like product likes/dislikes and cloud hosting with automated deployments.

## Key Features:

Create, retrieve, update, and delete products in the catalog.
Like and dislike products.
List and query products in the catalog.
Host the catalog in the cloud with automated deployment pipelines.
## Kanban Workflow:
The repository uses a Kanban board to:

- Manage the product backlog.
- Simulate sprints by moving user stories across stages: Icebox → Backlog → In Progress → Review/QA → Done.
- Display progress through a burndown chart.
## Purpose:
This project allows users to experience and practice the roles of a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer in an Agile environment.
